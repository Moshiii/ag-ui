## Issues Exposed by the Real Tests:

### 3. **Buffer Logic Mismatch** ✅ (as you pointed out)

```
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'content')
at textMessageBuffer: messages[messages.length - 1].content ?? ""
```

The real implementation tries to use `messages[messages.length - 1].content` as the buffer, but the message doesn't exist because the implementation doesn't actually create messages from events.

### 4. **Message Creation Not Working** ✅ (as you pointed out)

The implementation doesn't create messages from `TEXT_MESSAGE_START`/`CONTENT`/`END` events - that's why `messages[messages.length - 1]` is undefined.

### 5. **Tool Call Buffer Issues**

The tool call buffering is broken - showing empty buffers `""` and wrong tool call names `""` instead of the actual accumulated content.

### 6. **Error Handling Not Implemented** ✅ (as you noted)

```
Error: First subscriber error
```

Subscriber errors crash instead of being handled gracefully - the real implementation doesn't have error handling.

### 7. **State Mutation Issues**

```
Expected: {"modifiedBySubscriber": true}
Received: {"newCounter": 100}
```

The state mutations aren't working as expected.

## Summary

The tests are now correctly exposing that the real implementation is missing:

- ✅ **onEvent callback invocation** (0 calls instead of expected)
- ✅ **Message creation from events** (messages array stays empty)
- ✅ **Proper buffer accumulation** (trying to read non-existent message content)
- ✅ **Error handling** (errors crash instead of being handled)
- **Tool call buffer management** (buffers stay empty)
- **Event pipeline completion** (EmptyError suggests pipeline issues)

The tests are now authentic - they test against the real implementation and fail where the implementation has bugs, rather than passing against artificial mocks that don't reflect reality.
